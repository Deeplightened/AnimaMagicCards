Once established as a guest in a specific body, the spellcaster can jump on to any subject in the radius of effect, provided the new target fails the Resistance. An individual passing the Check cannot be affected by the spell independently of the caster’s attempts. Affected people do not usually realize they are being used even when spells are being cast through them. Anyone hosting the caster’s essence who leaves the area of effect of Life Mind is freed from the caster’s influence.The caster may specifically target any appropriate organism within the spell’s area of effect that he is aware of, but Life Mind cannot be used to detect the presence of living organisms. If the spellcaster has no obvious target, he can direct the power of the spell to simply join with the nearest appropriate target, if there is one. However, this method can be of very limited use, since it is quite possible the nearest living organism would be nothing more than a blade of grass.

The soul can be hosted in a living being, or an inanimate object such as a stone or a sword. A dead body, in good condition, can also serve as a host, in which case the body returns to life. The transmigrated soul adopts all the physical capabilities and limitations of the new host, retaining only its own intellectual, and possibly its animistic, capabilities. For example, if the new host is a tree, the soul will be able think, but it will be unable to speak or move. Once the transmigration is complete, the soul remains with its new host until the host is destroyed. If the soul transmigrates to a body, or object, already inhabited by another soul, the intruding soul will naturally meet resistance. The two souls engage in a struggle for dominion by each rolling 1d100 and adding their base Presence (no open rolls allowed); the highest total wins the struggle. If the difference between the two results is 100 or more, the winner consumes the other soul and takes control of the host permanently. If the difference is 50-99, the weaker soul is pacified and remains indefinitely asleep until something awakens it. If the difference is less than 50, the winner gains temporary control over the host, but the weaker soul remains awake and is entitled to a new check once per day.This spell can affect souls with a maximum Presence of no more than the level set by the spell. Both the affected soul and the targeted host can attempt to resist this spell with a MR check. This spell can affect deceased spirits still awaiting the Calling, but it cannot bring back spirits from the Flux.

The longer the period the more the spirit has spread and attached to the Flow of Souls. The spell has the power to bring spirits back, but not to tie them to their body or to heal it. For a completely effective resurrection, the soul should be placed in a suitable body using the spell Transmigrate Soul. However, it is possible that the time elapsed may have produced irreparable damage on the soul; therefore it is up to the GM to put some limit on the subject’s memories and knowledge. Destroyed or already reincarnated souls can not be resurrected. Resurrected spirits cannot have a base Presence higher than the limit set by spell level, and the elapsed time since death must be less than the limit set by the spell level.",
