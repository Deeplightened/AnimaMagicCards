The void is so powerful that anything coming into contact with the sphere weakens until it disappears. Each combat turn a victim remain within the dome, he must beat two distinct Resistance Checks; one is a MR Check which if failed causes him to lose a number of Zeon equivalent to the margin of failure, and the other is a PhR Check, which if failed causes him to lose as many points of Life Points as the Margin of Failure. When a victim has lost all Zeon, he begins to permanently lose one point of Power for every 100 points of Zeon he would continue to lose. If his Power falls to zero, or he dies from loss of Life Points, his being is totally swallowed by the nothingness.

This spell does not affect only the natural elements, though. It can influence the feelings and instincts of living beings, making lovers hate each other with a passion, or irreconcilable enemies form bonds of peace. The spell can even affect the passage of time, making it flow more quickly or slowly (it cannot be used to travel to the past, however). That is to say, Chaos is capable of affecting practically any imaginable facet of reality. The caster can designate a specific aspect of reality he wishes to alter, or on the other hand, transform it completely. In either case, this spell does not give the caster direct control over what is changing, so the results and consequences of events can be, as the name of the spell implies, completely chaotic.Chaos covers a maximum radius determined by the spell level, and is static in the place it was cast.
