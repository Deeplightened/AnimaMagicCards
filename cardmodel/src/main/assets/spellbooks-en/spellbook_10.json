He might create a city out of nowhere and turn it into a fantasy land in the next turn, for example. Imagination is the limit. This spell covers a one mile radius within which all illusions have Ghostly Spell status. Everyone entering the spell’s radius must pass a MR Check or fall beneath the power of this spell. World of Lies also allows the caster to create unreal creatures to populate it. These creatures exist as illusions of a Ghostly nature. The caster has levels at his disposal to distribute among these entities—although none of them can have more than half of the caster's level rounded up. The entities are fashioned according to the caster’s desires using the Beings Between Worlds rules in Chapter 26. These creatures have illusory intelligence and life; they are able to act independently following the orders given by their master. Those characters entering the area of influence and failing the Resistance Check can only repeat it when encountering doubts on the reality of their surroundings.Casting Level Base Intermediate Advanced Arcane",

      "effect": "This spell creates a distorted reality and makes something fake real. In this way, events that can have never taken place can be invented and made to produce effects upon the present. History is not really altered, since the spell only manages to change the status of things at the time it is cast. However, few people are able to tell the difference. The spell can not accomplish the impossible; it can only alter feasible events which are likely to happen if the appropriate situation is created by the caster.For example, the caster might say a certain mountain pass has been blocked due to a landslide caused by thieves making their escape. According to this, the False Reality spell would affect a random bunch of burglars and all individuals in the mountain pass at the time. Another example may be that the caster could claim that a non-existent entity, called Ethon, is about to destroy a city. He only needs to be able to justify the birth of the creature by saying, for instance, that it was created by a powerful sorcerer in the past. It is all up to the creativity he puts into the lie.Utilizing MR Checks for this spell is hard to do. It is necessary to find the being or object with the highest Resistance introduced “within the lie” or affected by it. In the first of the examples above, the burglars would make the MR Check.However, if a high-level individual crossed the pass at the time, he would use his Magic Resistance instead of the thieves. In the second example, a sorcerer powerful enough to create Ethon would be the one who do the Check. Whoever he is, the chosen individual may resist (disbelieve) this spell with a MR Check . The GM can adjust this Difficulty depending on the nature of the False Realty created. Extremely absurd events or circumstances should be easier to disbelieve.",
