Recreate also eliminates the effects of any Supernatural Abilities that have diminished the individual or object physically or spiritually; it restores lost memories or DP.

It therefore cannot “restore” a person to an earlier state that was damaged or inferior. Secondly, it has no jurisdiction over deceased souls, or those that have passed into the Flow, so is unable to return the dead to life.

If someone attempts to cross it, they exit at another point of The Barrier, completely unaware of what is behind (it is even possible to turn directly around without noting it). Transport is not automatic, rather, little by little, reality starts adapting to the exit location almost imperceptibly (Inhuman difficulty for Notice).As an example, The Barrier can be used over an island, to separate it from the rest of the world. That location disappears from view, and any ship sailing in the area will see only water, being transported immediately to another place to innocently continue their voyage. The Barrier need not be made absolutely perfect. The caster can choose to deliberately leave passages or openings, in one or both directions, to use for crossing. There are certain requirements for someone to be able to pass through it. To start with, it must be someone with a Gnosis greater than 25 who knows of The Barrier and its exact location. If both conditions are fulfilled, he must pass a MR Check to get through. If he fails, he can only repeat the check once per day.
